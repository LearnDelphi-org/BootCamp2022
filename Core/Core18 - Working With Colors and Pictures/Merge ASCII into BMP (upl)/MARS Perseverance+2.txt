NASA's Perseverance Celebrates First Year on Mars by Learning to Run 
====================================================================
___________________________________________________________________________
The rover has racked up a series of accomplishments, including new distance 
records, as it reaches the end of the first of several planned science 
campaigns on the Red Planet.
___________________________________________________________________________

NASA’s Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching 
down on Mars one year ago, on Feb. 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist 
has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new 
destination and a new science campaign.

Weighing roughly 1 ton (1,025 kilograms), Perseverance is the heaviest rover 
ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover 
collected the first rock core samples from another planet (it’s carrying six 
so far), served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first 
helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization 
Experiment), the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet.

Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a 
Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet (320 meters) on 
Feb. 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed 
the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance 
to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles.

The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a 
location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the 
oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have 
recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations 
to search for signs of ancient microscopic life.

Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection 
system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor – 
the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign.

“The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology 
for the formation of Jezero Crater,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate 
administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Each one 
is carefully considered for its scientific value.”

Counting the Eons
=================
Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the “Ch'al” rock type 
(named with the Navajo term for “frog”), a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative 
of what’s seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are 
returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero’s 
formation and the lake that once resided there.

Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon’s surface by counting its 
impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters 
of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their 
estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They’ve taken those lessons to 
narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from 
the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is – 
and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars’ geological history.
 
“Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and 
extrapolate that to Mars,” said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance’s deputy project 
cientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages 
the rover mission. “Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in 
Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system 
independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.”

The mission hasn’t been without challenges. The rover’s first attempt at drilling 
a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better 
understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had 
dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits.

Perseverance’s airborne companion, NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven 
similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm 
before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the 
rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective 
of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance’s team to plan the path ahead.

To the west of “Octavia E. Butler Landing,” where Perseverance started its journey, 
are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake 
in Jezero Crater. Deltas accumulate sediment over time, potentially trapping organic 
matter and possible biosignatures – signs of life – that may be in the environment. 
That makes this destination, which the mission expects to reach this summer, a 
highlight of the year to come.

More About the Mission
======================
A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the 
search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s 
geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and 
be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and 
dust).

Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would 
send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return 
them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration 
approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for 
human exploration of the Red Planet.

JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages 
operations of the Perseverance rover.

Perseverance (rover)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Perseverance, nicknamed Percy,[2] is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore 
the Jezero crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. It was manufactured 
by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched on 30 July 2020, at 11:50 UTC.[3] 
Confirmation that the rover successfully landed on Mars was received on 18 February 
2021, at 20:55 UTC.[4][5] As of 22 July 2022, Perseverance has been active on Mars 
for 505 sols (519 Earth days, or 1 year, 5 months and 4 days) since its landing. 
Following the rover's arrival, NASA named the landing site Octavia E. Butler Landing.[6][7] 
Perseverance has a similar design to its predecessor rover, Curiosity, from which 
it was moderately upgraded. It carries seven primary payload instruments, nineteen 
cameras, and two microphones.[8] 

The rover also carried the mini-helicopter Ingenuity to Mars, an experimental 
aircraft and technology testbed that made the first powered flight on another 
planet on 19 April 2021.[9] As of April 21, 2022, it has made 26 successful 
flights.[10][11] Ingenuity's 25th successful flight, which occurred on April 8, 
2022, saw the helicopter set new records for highest speed and distance traveled 
during a single flight.[12] 

The rover's goals include identifying ancient Martian environments capable of 
supporting life, seeking out evidence of former microbial life existing in those 
environments, collecting rock and soil samples to store on the Martian surface, 
and testing oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere to prepare for future 
crewed missions.[13] 

Mission
=======
Further information: Timeline of Mars 2020
Science objectives
The Perseverance rover has four main science objectives[14] that support the Mars 
Exploration Program's science goals:[13] 
•	Looking for habitability: identify past environments that were capable of 
supporting microbial life.
•	Seeking biosignatures: seek signs of possible past microbial life in those 
habitable environments, particularly in specific rock types known to preserve 
signs over time.
•	Caching samples: collect core rock and regolith ("soil") samples and store 
them on the Martian surface.
•	Preparing for humans: test oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere.
In the first science campaign Perseverance performs an arching drive southward 
from its landing site to the Séítah unit to perform a "toe dip" into the unit to 
collect remote-sensing measurements of geologic targets. After that it will return 
to the Crater Floor Fractured Rough to collect the first core sample there. Passing 
by the Octavia B. Butler landing site concludes the first science campaign. 

The second campaign will include several months of travel towards the "Three Forks" 
where Perseverance can access geologic locations at the base of the ancient delta 
of Neretva river, as well as ascend the delta by driving up a valley wall to the 
northwest.[15] 

Despite the high-profile success of the Curiosity rover landing in August 2012, 
NASA's Mars Exploration Program was in a state of uncertainty in the early 2010s. 
Budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of a planned collaboration with the European 
Space Agency which included a rover mission.[16] By the summer of 2012, a program 
that had been launching a mission to Mars every two years suddenly found itself
 with no missions approved after 2013.[17] 

In 2011, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, a report from the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine containing an influential set of 
recommendations made by the planetary science community, stated that the top priority 
of NASA's planetary exploration program in the decade between 2013 and 2022 should 
be to begin a Mars Sample Return campaign, a four-mission project to cache, 
retrieve, launch, and safely return samples of the Martian surface to Earth. 
The report stated that NASA should invest in a sample-caching rover as the first 
step in this effort, with the goal of keeping costs under US$2.5 billion.[18]
 
After the success of the Curiosity rover and in response to the recommendations
 of the decadal survey, NASA announced its intent to launch a new Mars rover 
mission by 2020 at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2012.[19]
 
Though initially hesitant to commit to an ambitious sample-caching capability 
(and subsequent follow-on missions), a NASA-convened science definition team 
for the Mars 2020 project released a report in July 2013 that the mission 
should "select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache."[20]
 
Design
======
The Perseverance design evolved from its predecessor, the Curiosity rover. The
 two rovers share a similar body plan, landing system, cruise stage, and power
 system, but the design was improved in several ways for Perseverance. Engineers 
designed the rover wheels to be more robust than Curiosity's wheels, which have 
sustained some damage.[21] Perseverance has thicker, more durable aluminum wheels, 
with reduced width and a greater diameter, 52.5 cm (20.7 in), than Curiosity's 50 cm 
(20 in) wheels.[22][23] The aluminum wheels are covered with cleats for traction 
and curved titanium spokes for springy support.[24] The heat shield for the rover 
was made out of phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator (PICA), to allow it to withstand 
up to 2,400 °F (1,320 °C) of heat.[25] Like Curiosity, the rover includes a robotic 
arm, although Perseverance's arm is longer and stronger, measuring 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in).
 
The arm hosts an elaborate rock-coring and sampling mechanism to store geologic
 samples from the Martian surface in sterile caching tubes.[26] There is also a 
secondary arm hidden below the rover that helps store the chalk-sized samples.
 This arm is known as the Sample Handling Assembly (SHA), and is responsible for 
moving the soil samples to various stations within the Adaptive Caching Assembly 
(ACA) on the underside of the rover. These stations include volume assessment 
(measuring the length of sample), imaging, seal dispensing, and hermetic seal 
station, among others.[27] Owing to the small space in which the SHA must operate, 
as well as load requirements during sealing activities, the Sample Caching System 
"is the most complicated, most sophisticated mechanism that we have ever built, 
tested and readied for spaceflight."[28] 

The combination of larger instruments, new sampling and caching system, and 
modified wheels makes Perseverance heavier, weighing 1,025 kg (2,260 lb) compared 
to Curiosity at 899 kg (1,982 lb)—a 14% increase.[30] 

The rover's radioisotope thermoelectric power generator (MMRTG) has a mass of 45 kg 
(99 lb) and uses 4.8 kg (11 lb) of Plutonium-238 oxide as its power source. The 
natural decay of plutonium-238, which has a half-life of 87.7 years, gives off 
heat which is converted to electricity—approximately 110 watts at launch.[31]
 
This will decrease over time as its power source decays.[31] The MMRTG charges 
two lithium-ion rechargeable batteries which power the rover's activities, and 
must be recharged periodically. Unlike solar panels, the MMRTG provides engineers 
with significant flexibility in operating the rover's instruments even at night, 
during dust storms, and through winter.[31] 

The rover's computer uses the BAE Systems RAD750 radiation-hardened single board 
computer based on a ruggedized PowerPC G3 microprocessor (PowerPC 750). The 
computer contains 128 megabytes of volatile DRAM, and runs at 133 MHz. The flight 
software runs on the VxWorks Operating System, is written in C and is able to 
access 4 gigabytes of NAND non-volatile memory on a separate card.[32] Perseverance 
relies on three antennas for telemetry, all of which are relayed through craft
 currently in orbit around Mars. The primary UHF antenna can send data from 
the rover at a maximum rate of two megabits per second.[33] Two slower X-band 
antennas provide communications redundancy. 

Twin rover
==========
JPL built a copy of the Perseverance; a twin rover used for testing and problem 
solving, OPTIMISM (Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms 
and Instruments Sent to Mars), a vehicle system test bed (VSTB). It is housed at 
the JPL Mars Yard and is used to test operational procedures and to aid in problem 
solving should any issues arise with Perseverance.[34] 

Mars Ingenuity helicopter experiment
====================================
The Ingenuity helicopter, powered by solar-charged batteries, was sent to Mars 
in the same bundle with Perseverance. With a mass of 1.8 kg (4.0 lb), it demonstrated 
the reality of flight in the rarefied Martian atmosphere and the potential 
usefulness of aerial scouting for rover missions. Its pre-launch experimental 
test plan was 3 flights in 45 days. As of April 21, 2022, it has made 26 successful 
flights.[35][36] Ingenuity's 25th successful flight, which occurred on April 8, 2022, 
saw the helicopter set new records for highest speed and distance traveled during
 a single flight.[37][38] It carries two cameras but no scientific instruments[39][40][41]
 and communicates with Earth via a base station onboard Perseverance.[42] The first 
takeoff was attempted on 19 April 2021 at 07:15 UTC, with livestreaming three hours
 later at 10:15 UTC confirming the flight.[43][44][45][46][47] It was the first 
powered flight by an aircraft on another planet.[9] Ingenuity made additional 
incrementally more ambitious flights, several of which were recorded by Perseverance's cameras. 

Name
====
Associate Administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Thomas Zurbuchen selected the name Perseverance following a nationwide K-12 student "name the rover" contest that attracted more than 28,000 proposals. A seventh-grade student, Alexander Mather from Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia, submitted the winning entry at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition to the honor of naming the rover, Mather and his family were invited to NASA's Kennedy Space Center to watch the rover's July 2020 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida.[48] 
Mather wrote in his winning essay:
Curiosity. InSight. Spirit. Opportunity. If you think about it, all of these names of past Mars rovers are qualities we possess as humans. We are always curious, and seek opportunity. We have the spirit and insight to explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond. But, if rovers are to be the qualities of us as a race, we missed the most important thing. Perseverance. We as humans evolved as creatures who could learn to adapt to any situation, no matter how harsh. We are a species of explorers, and we will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars. However, we can persevere. We, not as a nation but as humans, will not give up. The human race will always persevere into the future.[48]
Mars transit
The Perseverance rover lifted off successfully on 30 July 2020, at 11:50:00 UTC aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V launch vehicle from Space Launch Complex 41, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida.[49] 
The rover took about seven months to travel to Mars and made its landing in Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021, to begin its science phase.[50] 
After 17 May 2022, The rover will roll uphill, stopping every so often to examine rocks that look to have the best chance of retaining evidence of past life on the planet Mars. On its way back down, Perseverance will collect some of these rocks, placing the samples at the base of the delta to be retrieved by later missions. The goal is to bring this material back to Earth in the 2030s for detailed inspection.[51] 
Landing
The successful landing of Perseverance in Jezero Crater was announced at 20:55 UTC on 18 February 2021,[4] the signal from Mars taking 11 minutes to arrive at Earth. The rover touched down at 18.4446°N 77.4509°E,[52] roughly 1 km (0.62 mi) southeast of the center of its 7.7 × 6.6 km (4.8 × 4.1 mi)[53] wide landing ellipse. It came down pointed almost directly to the southeast,[54] with the RTG on the back of the vehicle pointing northwest. The descent stage ("sky crane"), parachute and heat shield all came to rest within 1.5 km of the rover (see satellite image). The landing was more accurate than any previous Mars landing; a feat enabled by the experience gained from Curiosity's landing and the use of new steering technology.[53] 
One such new technology is Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), a technique in which the rover compares images of the surface taken during its descent with reference maps, allowing it to make last minute adjustments to its course. The rover also uses the images to select a safe landing site at the last minute, allowing it to land in relatively unhazardous terrain. This enables it to land much closer to its science objectives than previous missions, which all had to use a landing ellipse devoid of hazards.[53] 
The landing occurred in the late afternoon, with the first images taken at 15:53:58 on the mission clock (local mean solar time).[55] The landing took place shortly after Mars passed through its northern vernal equinox (Ls = 5.2°), at the start of the astronomical spring, the equivalent of the end of March on Earth.[56] 
The parachute descent of the Perseverance rover was photographed by the HiRISE high-resolution camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).[57] 
Jezero Crater is a paleolake basin.[58][59] It was selected as the landing site for this mission in part because paleolake basins tend to contain perchlorates.[58][59] Astrobiologist Dr. Kennda Lynch's work in analog environments on Earth suggests that the composition of the crater, including the bottomset deposits accumulated from three different sources in the area, is a likely place to discover evidence of perchlorates-reducing microbes, if such bacteria are living or were formerly living on Mars.[58][59] 
Video of Perseverance's parachute deployment and powered landing sequence
A few days after landing, Perseverance released the first audio recorded on the surface of Mars, capturing the sound of Martian wind[60][61] 
During its travels on Mars, NASA scientists had observed around Sol 341 (February 4, 2022) that a small rock had dropped into one of its wheels while the rover was studying the Máaz rock formation. The rock was visible from one of the hazard avoidance cameras, and was determined not to be harmful to the rover's mission. The rock has since stayed on Perseverance's wheels for at least 123 sols (126 days) as the rover traveled over 5 miles (8.0 km) on the surface. NASA deemed that Perseverance had adopted a pet rock for its journey.[62][63] 
Instruments
WATSON camera views rocks (Mars; video; 0:05; 10 May 2021)
NASA considered nearly 60 proposals[65][66] for rover instrumentation. On 31 July 2014, NASA announced the seven instruments that would make up the payload for the rover:[67][68] 
•	Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), an exploration technology investigation to produce a small amount of oxygen (O2) from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). On 20 April 2021, 5.37 grams of oxygen were produced in an hour, with nine more extractions planned over the course of two Earth years to further investigate the instrument.[69] This technology could be scaled up in the future for human life support or to make the rocket fuel for return missions.[70][71]
•	Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials.[72][73][74]
•	Radar Imager for Mars' subsurface experiment (RIMFAX), a ground-penetrating radar to image different ground densities, structural layers, buried rocks, meteorites, and detect underground water ice and salty brine at 10 m (33 ft) depth. The RIMFAX is being provided by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI).[75][76][77][78]
•	Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA), a set of sensors that measure temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity, radiation, and dust particle size and shape. It is provided by Spain's Centro de Astrobiología.[79]
•	SuperCam, an instrument suite that can provide imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy in rocks and regolith from a distance. It is an upgraded version of the ChemCam on the Curiosity rover but with two lasers and four spectrometers that will allow it to remotely identify biosignatures and assess the past habitability. SuperCam is used in conjucntion with the AEGIS targeting system. Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP) in France, the French Space Agency (CNES), the University of Hawaii, and the University of Valladolid in Spain cooperated in the SuperCam's development and manufacture.[80][81]
•	Mastcam-Z, a stereoscopic imaging system with the ability to zoom.[82][83] Many photos were included in the published NASA photogallery. (Including Raw)
•	Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC), an ultraviolet Raman spectrometer that uses fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds.[84][85]
There are additional cameras and two audio microphones (the first working microphones on Mars), that will be used for engineering support during landing,[86] driving, and collecting samples.[87][88] For a full look at Perseverance's components see Learn About the Rover. 
It is planned for Perseverance to visit the bottom and upper parts of the 3.4 to 3.8 billion-year-old Neretva Vallis delta, the smooth and etched parts of the Jezero Crater floor deposits interpreted as volcanic ash or aeolian airfall deposits, emplaced before the formation of the delta; the ancient shoreline covered with Transverse Aeolian Ridges (dunes) and mass wasting deposits, and finally, it is planned to climb onto the Jezero Crater rim.[90] 
In its progressive commissioning and tests, Perseverance made its first test drive on Mars on 4 March 2021. NASA released photographs of the rover's first wheel tracks on the Martian soil.[91] 

Samples cached for the Mars sample-return mission
In support of the Mars sample-return mission, rock, regolith (Martian 'soil'), and atmosphere samples are being cached by Perseverance. Currently, out of 43 sample tubes, rock sample tubes cached: 10,[92] atmosphere sample tubes cached: 1,[93] witness tubes cached: 1,[94] tubes due to be cached: 31. Before launch, 5 of the 43 tubes were designated “witness tubes” and filled with materials that would capture particulates in the ambient environment of Mars.[95] 
Cost
NASA plans to invest roughly US$2.75 billion in the project over 11 years, including US$2.2 billion for the development and building of the hardware, US$243 million for launch services, and US$291 million for 2.5 years of mission operations.[8][96] 
Adjusted for inflation, Perseverance is NASA's sixth-most expensive robotic planetary mission, though it is cheaper than its predecessor, Curiosity.[97] Perseverance benefited from spare hardware and "build-to print" designs from the Curiosity mission, which helped reduce development costs and saved "probably tens of millions, if not 100 million dollars" according to Mars 2020 Deputy Chief Engineer Keith Comeaux.[98] 
Commemorative artifacts
"Send Your Name to Mars"
NASA's "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign invited people from around the world to submit their names to travel aboard the agency's next rover to Mars. 10,932,295 names were submitted. The names were etched by an electron beam onto three fingernail-sized silicon chips, along with the essays of the 155 finalists in NASA's "Name the Rover" contest. The three chips share space on an anodized plate with a laser engraved graphic representing Earth, Mars, and the Sun. The rays emanating from the Sun contain the phrase "Explore As One" written in Morse code.[99] The plate was then mounted on the rover on 26 March 2020.[100] 
Part of Perseverance's cargo is a geocaching trackable item viewable with the SHERLOC's WATSON camera.[101] 
In 2016, NASA SHERLOC co-investigator Dr. Marc Fries — with help from his son Wyatt — was inspired by Geocaching's 2008 placement of a cache on the International Space Station to set out and try something similar with the rover mission. After floating the idea around mission management, it eventually reached NASA scientist Francis McCubbin, who would join the SHERLOC instrument team as a collaborator to move the project forward. The Geocaching inclusion was scaled-down to a trackable item that players could search for from NASA camera views and then log on to the site.[102] In a manner similar to the "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign, the geocaching trackable code was carefully printed on a one-inch, polycarbonate glass disk serving as part of the rover's calibration target. It will serve as an optical target for the WATSON imager and a spectroscopic standard for the SHERLOC instrument. The disk is made of a prototype astronaut helmet visor material that will be tested for its potential use in crewed missions to Mars. Designs were approved by the mission leads at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Public Affairs, and NASA HQ, in addition to Groundspeak Geocaching HQ.[103][104] 
Tribute to healthcare workers
Perseverance launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, which began to affect the mission planning in March 2020. To show appreciation for healthcare workers who helped during the pandemic, an 8 cm × 13 cm (3.1 in × 5.1 in) plate with a staff-and-serpent symbol (a Greek symbol of medicine) was placed on the rover. The project manager, Matt Wallace, said he hoped that future generations going to Mars would be able to appreciate healthcare workers during 2020.[105] 
Family portrait of NASA Mars rovers
One of the external plates of Perseverance includes a simplified representation of all previous NASA Martian rovers, Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, as well as Perseverance and Ingenuity, similar to the trend of automobile window decals used to show a family's makeup.[106] 
NASA outreach to students
In December 2021, the NASA team announced a program to students who have persevered with academic challenges. Those nominated will be rewarded with a personal message beamed back from Mars by the Perseverance rover. 
Media, cultural impact, and legacy
Parachute with coded message
The orange-and-white parachute used to land the rover on Mars contained a coded message that was deciphered by Twitter users. NASA's systems engineer Ian Clark used binary code to hide the message "dare mighty things" in the parachute color pattern. The 70-foot-wide (21 m) parachute consisted of 80 strips of fabric that form a hemisphere-shape canopy, and each strip consisted of four pieces. Dr. Clark thus had 320 pieces with which to encode the message. He also included the GPS coordinates for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's headquarters in Pasadena, California (34°11’58” N 118°10’31” W). Clark said that only six people knew about the message before landing. The code was deciphered a few hours after the image was presented by Perseverance's team.[107][108][109] 
"Dare mighty things" is a quote attributed to U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt and is the unofficial motto of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[110] It adorns many of the JPL center's wall.

NASA's Perseverance Celebrates First Year on Mars by Learning to Run 
====================================================================
___________________________________________________________________________
The rover has racked up a series of accomplishments, including new distance 
records, as it reaches the end of the first of several planned science 
campaigns on the Red Planet.
___________________________________________________________________________

NASA’s Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching 
down on Mars one year ago, on Feb. 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist 
has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new 
destination and a new science campaign.

Weighing roughly 1 ton (1,025 kilograms), Perseverance is the heaviest rover 
ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover 
collected the first rock core samples from another planet (it’s carrying six 
so far), served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first 
helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization 
Experiment), the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet.

Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a 
Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet (320 meters) on 
Feb. 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed 
the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance 
to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles.

The rover has nearly wrapped up its first science campaign in Jezero Crater, a 
location that contained a lake billions of years ago and features some of the 
oldest rocks Mars scientists have been able to study up close. Rocks that have 
recorded and preserved environments that once hosted water are prime locations 
to search for signs of ancient microscopic life.

Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection 
system in its belly, Perseverance is snagging rock cores from the crater floor – 
the first step in the Mars Sample Return campaign.

“The samples Perseverance has been collecting will provide a key chronology 
for the formation of Jezero Crater,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate 
administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Each one 
is carefully considered for its scientific value.”

Counting the Eons
=================
Two more samples will be collected in coming weeks from the “Ch'al” rock type 
(named with the Navajo term for “frog”), a set of dark, rubbly rocks representative 
of what’s seen across much of the crater floor. If samples of these rocks are 
returned to Earth, scientists think they could provide an age range for Jezero’s 
formation and the lake that once resided there.

Scientists can approximate the age of a planet or moon’s surface by counting its 
impact craters. Older surfaces have had more time to accumulate impact craters 
of various sizes. In the case of the Moon, scientists were able to refine their 
estimates by analyzing Apollo lunar samples. They’ve taken those lessons to 
narrow down the age estimates of surfaces on Mars. But having rock samples from 
the Red Planet would improve crater-based estimates of how old the surface is – 
and help them find more pieces of the puzzle that is Mars’ geological history.
 
“Right now, we take what we know about the age of impact craters on the Moon and 
extrapolate that to Mars,” said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance’s deputy project 
cientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages 
the rover mission. “Bringing back a sample from this heavily cratered surface in 
Jezero could provide a tie-point to calibrate the Mars crater dating system 
independently, instead of relying solely on the lunar one.”

The mission hasn’t been without challenges. The rover’s first attempt at drilling 
a rock core came up empty, prompting an extensive testing campaign to better 
understand fragile rocks. The team also needed to clear out pebbles that had 
dropped into the part of the sampling system that holds the drill bits.

Perseverance’s airborne companion, NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, has proven 
similarly plucky: It was grounded for almost a month following a dust storm 
before recently resuming its flights. Originally slated to fly five times, the 
rotorcraft has successfully completed 19 flights now, providing a new perspective 
of Martian terrain and helping Perseverance’s team to plan the path ahead.

To the west of “Octavia E. Butler Landing,” where Perseverance started its journey, 
are the remains of a fan-shaped delta formed by an ancient river as it fed the lake 
in Jezero Crater. Deltas accumulate sediment over time, potentially trapping organic 
matter and possible biosignatures – signs of life – that may be in the environment. 
That makes this destination, which the mission expects to reach this summer, a 
highlight of the year to come.

More About the Mission
======================
A key objective for Perseverance’s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the 
search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet’s 
geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and 
be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and 
dust).

Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would 
send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return 
them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration 
approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for 
human exploration of the Red Planet.

JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages 
operations of the Perseverance rover.

Perseverance (rover)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Perseverance, nicknamed Percy,[2] is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore 
the Jezero crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. It was manufactured 
by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched on 30 July 2020, at 11:50 UTC.[3] 
Confirmation that the rover successfully landed on Mars was received on 18 February 
2021, at 20:55 UTC.[4][5] As of 22 July 2022, Perseverance has been active on Mars 
for 505 sols (519 Earth days, or 1 year, 5 months and 4 days) since its landing. 
Following the rover's arrival, NASA named the landing site Octavia E. Butler Landing.[6][7] 
Perseverance has a similar design to its predecessor rover, Curiosity, from which 
it was moderately upgraded. It carries seven primary payload instruments, nineteen 
cameras, and two microphones.[8] 

The rover also carried the mini-helicopter Ingenuity to Mars, an experimental 
aircraft and technology testbed that made the first powered flight on another 
planet on 19 April 2021.[9] As of April 21, 2022, it has made 26 successful 
flights.[10][11] Ingenuity's 25th successful flight, which occurred on April 8, 
2022, saw the helicopter set new records for highest speed and distance traveled 
during a single flight.[12] 

The rover's goals include identifying ancient Martian environments capable of 
supporting life, seeking out evidence of former microbial life existing in those 
environments, collecting rock and soil samples to store on the Martian surface, 
and testing oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere to prepare for future 
crewed missions.[13] 

Mission
=======

Science objectives
The Perseverance rover has four main science objectives[14] that support the Mars 
Exploration Program's science goals:[13] 
•	Looking for habitability: identify past environments that were capable of 
supporting microbial life.
•	Seeking biosignatures: seek signs of possible past microbial life in those 
habitable environments, particularly in specific rock types known to preserve 
signs over time.
•	Caching samples: collect core rock and regolith ("soil") samples and store 
them on the Martian surface.
•	Preparing for humans: test oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere.
In the first science campaign Perseverance performs an arching drive southward 
from its landing site to the Séítah unit to perform a "toe dip" into the unit to 
collect remote-sensing measurements of geologic targets. After that it will return 
to the Crater Floor Fractured Rough to collect the first core sample there. Passing 
by the Octavia B. Butler landing site concludes the first science campaign. 

The second campaign will include several months of travel towards the "Three Forks" 
where Perseverance can access geologic locations at the base of the ancient delta 
of Neretva river, as well as ascend the delta by driving up a valley wall to the 
northwest.[15] 

Despite the high-profile success of the Curiosity rover landing in August 2012, 
NASA's Mars Exploration Program was in a state of uncertainty in the early 2010s. 
Budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of a planned collaboration with the European 
Space Agency which included a rover mission.[16] By the summer of 2012, a program 
that had been launching a mission to Mars every two years suddenly found itself
 with no missions approved after 2013.[17] 

In 2011, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, a report from the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine containing an influential set of 
recommendations made by the planetary science community, stated that the top priority 
of NASA's planetary exploration program in the decade between 2013 and 2022 should 
be to begin a Mars Sample Return campaign, a four-mission project to cache, 
retrieve, launch, and safely return samples of the Martian surface to Earth. 
The report stated that NASA should invest in a sample-caching rover as the first 
step in this effort, with the goal of keeping costs under US$2.5 billion.[18]
 
After the success of the Curiosity rover and in response to the recommendations
 of the decadal survey, NASA announced its intent to launch a new Mars rover 
mission by 2020 at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2012.[19]
 
Though initially hesitant to commit to an ambitious sample-caching capability 
(and subsequent follow-on missions), a NASA-convened science definition team 
for the Mars 2020 project released a report in July 2013 that the mission 
should "select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache."[20]
 
Design
======
The Perseverance design evolved from its predecessor, the Curiosity rover. The
 two rovers share a similar body plan, landing system, cruise stage, and power
 system, but the design was improved in several ways for Perseverance. Engineers 
designed the rover wheels to be more robust than Curiosity's wheels, which have 
sustained some damage.[21] Perseverance has thicker, more durable aluminum wheels, 
with reduced width and a greater diameter, 52.5 cm (20.7 in), than Curiosity's 50 cm 
(20 in) wheels.[22][23] The aluminum wheels are covered with cleats for traction 
and curved titanium spokes for springy support.[24] The heat shield for the rover 
was made out of phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator (PICA), to allow it to withstand 
up to 2,400 °F (1,320 °C) of heat.[25] Like Curiosity, the rover includes a robotic 
arm, although Perseverance's arm is longer and stronger, measuring 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in).
 
The arm hosts an elaborate rock-coring and sampling mechanism to store geologic
 samples from the Martian surface in sterile caching tubes.[26] There is also a 
secondary arm hidden below the rover that helps store the chalk-sized samples.
 This arm is known as the Sample Handling Assembly (SHA), and is responsible for 
moving the soil samples to various stations within the Adaptive Caching Assembly 
(ACA) on the underside of the rover. These stations include volume assessment 
(measuring the length of sample), imaging, seal dispensing, and hermetic seal 
station, among others.[27] Owing to the small space in which the SHA must operate, 
as well as load requirements during sealing activities, the Sample Caching System 
"is the most complicated, most sophisticated mechanism that we have ever built, 
tested and readied for spaceflight."[28] 

The combination of larger instruments, new sampling and caching system, and 
modified wheels makes Perseverance heavier, weighing 1,025 kg (2,260 lb) compared 
to Curiosity at 899 kg (1,982 lb)—a 14% increase.[30] 

The rover's radioisotope thermoelectric power generator (MMRTG) has a mass of 45 kg 
(99 lb) and uses 4.8 kg (11 lb) of Plutonium-238 oxide as its power source. The 
natural decay of plutonium-238, which has a half-life of 87.7 years, gives off 
heat which is converted to electricity—approximately 110 watts at launch.[31]
 
This will decrease over time as its power source decays.[31] The MMRTG charges 
two lithium-ion rechargeable batteries which power the rover's activities, and 
must be recharged periodically. Unlike solar panels, the MMRTG provides engineers 
with significant flexibility in operating the rover's instruments even at night, 
during dust storms, and through winter.[31] 

The rover's computer uses the BAE Systems RAD750 radiation-hardened single board 
computer based on a ruggedized PowerPC G3 microprocessor (PowerPC 750). The 
computer contains 128 megabytes of volatile DRAM, and runs at 133 MHz. The flight 
software runs on the VxWorks Operating System, is written in C and is able to 
access 4 gigabytes of NAND non-volatile memory on a separate card.[32] Perseverance 
relies on three antennas for telemetry, all of which are relayed through craft
 currently in orbit around Mars. The primary UHF antenna can send data from 
the rover at a maximum rate of two megabits per second.[33] Two slower X-band 
antennas provide communications redundancy. 

Twin rover
==========
JPL built a copy of the Perseverance; a twin rover used for testing and problem 
solving, OPTIMISM (Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms 
and Instruments Sent to Mars), a vehicle system test bed (VSTB). It is housed at 
the JPL Mars Yard and is used to test operational procedures and to aid in problem 
solving should any issues arise with Perseverance.[34] 

Mars Ingenuity helicopter experiment
====================================
The Ingenuity helicopter, powered by solar-charged batteries, was sent to Mars 
in the same bundle with Perseverance. With a mass of 1.8 kg (4.0 lb), it demonstrated 
the reality of flight in the rarefied Martian atmosphere and the potential 
usefulness of aerial scouting for rover missions. Its pre-launch experimental 
test plan was 3 flights in 45 days. As of April 21, 2022, it has made 26 successful 
flights.[35][36] Ingenuity's 25th successful flight, which occurred on April 8, 2022, 
saw the helicopter set new records for highest speed and distance traveled during
 a single flight.[37][38] It carries two cameras but no scientific instruments[39][40][41]
 and communicates with Earth via a base station onboard Perseverance.[42] The first 
takeoff was attempted on 19 April 2021 at 07:15 UTC, with livestreaming three hours
 later at 10:15 UTC confirming the flight.[43][44][45][46][47] It was the first 
powered flight by an aircraft on another planet.[9] Ingenuity made additional 
incrementally more ambitious flights, several of which were recorded by Perseverance's cameras. 

Name
====
Associate Administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Thomas Zurbuchen selected the name Perseverance following a nationwide K-12 student "name the rover" contest that attracted more than 28,000 proposals. A seventh-grade student, Alexander Mather from Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia, submitted the winning entry at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition to the honor of naming the rover, Mather and his family were invited to NASA's Kennedy Space Center to watch the rover's July 2020 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida.[48] 
Mather wrote in his winning essay:
Curiosity. InSight. Spirit. Opportunity. If you think about it, all of these names of past Mars rovers are qualities we possess as humans. We are always curious, and seek opportunity. We have the spirit and insight to explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond. But, if rovers are to be the qualities of us as a race, we missed the most important thing. Perseverance. We as humans evolved as creatures who could learn to adapt to any situation, no matter how harsh. We are a species of explorers, and we will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars. However, we can persevere. We, not as a nation but as humans, will not give up. The human race will always persevere into the future.[48]
Mars transit
The Perseverance rover lifted off successfully on 30 July 2020, at 11:50:00 UTC aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V launch vehicle from Space Launch Complex 41, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida.[49] 
The rover took about seven months to travel to Mars and made its landing in Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021, to begin its science phase.[50] 
After 17 May 2022, The rover will roll uphill, stopping every so often to examine rocks that look to have the best chance of retaining evidence of past life on the planet Mars. On its way back down, Perseverance will collect some of these rocks, placing the samples at the base of the delta to be retrieved by later missions. The goal is to bring this material back to Earth in the 2030s for detailed inspection.[51] 
Landing
The successful landing of Perseverance in Jezero Crater was announced at 20:55 UTC on 18 February 2021,[4] the signal from Mars taking 11 minutes to arrive at Earth. The rover touched down at 18.4446°N 77.4509°E,[52] roughly 1 km (0.62 mi) southeast of the center of its 7.7 × 6.6 km (4.8 × 4.1 mi)[53] wide landing ellipse. It came down pointed almost directly to the southeast,[54] with the RTG on the back of the vehicle pointing northwest. The descent stage ("sky crane"), parachute and heat shield all came to rest within 1.5 km of the rover (see satellite image). The landing was more accurate than any previous Mars landing; a feat enabled by the experience gained from Curiosity's landing and the use of new steering technology.[53] 
One such new technology is Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), a technique in which the rover compares images of the surface taken during its descent with reference maps, allowing it to make last minute adjustments to its course. The rover also uses the images to select a safe landing site at the last minute, allowing it to land in relatively unhazardous terrain. This enables it to land much closer to its science objectives than previous missions, which all had to use a landing ellipse devoid of hazards.[53] 
The landing occurred in the late afternoon, with the first images taken at 15:53:58 on the mission clock (local mean solar time).[55] The landing took place shortly after Mars passed through its northern vernal equinox (Ls = 5.2°), at the start of the astronomical spring, the equivalent of the end of March on Earth.[56] 
The parachute descent of the Perseverance rover was photographed by the HiRISE high-resolution camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).[57] 
Jezero Crater is a paleolake basin.[58][59] It was selected as the landing site for this mission in part because paleolake basins tend to contain perchlorates.[58][59] Astrobiologist Dr. Kennda Lynch's work in analog environments on Earth suggests that the composition of the crater, including the bottomset deposits accumulated from three different sources in the area, is a likely place to discover evidence of perchlorates-reducing microbes, if such bacteria are living or were formerly living on Mars.[58][59] 
Video of Perseverance's parachute deployment and powered landing sequence
A few days after landing, Perseverance released the first audio recorded on the surface of Mars, capturing the sound of Martian wind[60][61] 
During its travels on Mars, NASA scientists had observed around Sol 341 (February 4, 2022) that a small rock had dropped into one of its wheels while the rover was studying the Máaz rock formation. The rock was visible from one of the hazard avoidance cameras, and was determined not to be harmful to the rover's mission. The rock has since stayed on Perseverance's wheels for at least 123 sols (126 days) as the rover traveled over 5 miles (8.0 km) on the surface. NASA deemed that Perseverance had adopted a pet rock for its journey.[62][63] 
Instruments

NASA considered nearly 60 proposals[65][66] for rover instrumentation. On 31 July 2014, NASA announced the seven instruments that would make up the payload for the rover:[67][68] 
•	Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), an exploration technology investigation to produce a small amount of oxygen (O2) from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). On 20 April 2021, 5.37 grams of oxygen were produced in an hour, with nine more extractions planned over the course of two Earth years to further investigate the instrument.[69] This technology could be scaled up in the future for human life support or to make the rocket fuel for return missions.[70][71]
•	Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials.[72][73][74]
•	Radar Imager for Mars' subsurface experiment (RIMFAX), a ground-penetrating radar to image different ground densities, structural layers, buried rocks, meteorites, and detect underground water ice and salty brine at 10 m (33 ft) depth. The RIMFAX is being provided by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI).[75][76][77][78]
•	Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA), a set of sensors that measure temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity, radiation, and dust particle size and shape. It is provided by Spain's Centro de Astrobiología.[79]
•	SuperCam, an instrument suite that can provide imaging, chemical composition analysis, and mineralogy in rocks and regolith from a distance. It is an upgraded version of the ChemCam on the Curiosity rover but with two lasers and four spectrometers that will allow it to remotely identify biosignatures and assess the past habitability. SuperCam is used in conjucntion with the AEGIS targeting system. Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP) in France, the French Space Agency (CNES), the University of Hawaii, and the University of Valladolid in Spain cooperated in the SuperCam's development and manufacture.[80][81]
•	Mastcam-Z, a stereoscopic imaging system with the ability to zoom.[82][83] Many photos were included in the published NASA photogallery. (Including Raw)
•	Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC), an ultraviolet Raman spectrometer that uses fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds.[84][85]
There are additional cameras and two audio microphones (the first working microphones on Mars), that will be used for engineering support during landing,[86] driving, and collecting samples.[87][88] For a full look at Perseverance's components see Learn About the Rover. 
It is planned for Perseverance to visit the bottom and upper parts of the 3.4 to 3.8 billion-year-old Neretva Vallis delta, the smooth and etched parts of the Jezero Crater floor deposits interpreted as volcanic ash or aeolian airfall deposits, emplaced before the formation of the delta; the ancient shoreline covered with Transverse Aeolian Ridges (dunes) and mass wasting deposits, and finally, it is planned to climb onto the Jezero Crater rim.[90] 
In its progressive commissioning and tests, Perseverance made its first test drive on Mars on 4 March 2021. NASA released photographs of the rover's first wheel tracks on the Martian soil.[91] 

Samples cached for the Mars sample-return mission
In support of the Mars sample-return mission, rock, regolith (Martian 'soil'), and atmosphere samples are being cached by Perseverance. Currently, out of 43 sample tubes, rock sample tubes cached: 10,[92] atmosphere sample tubes cached: 1,[93] witness tubes cached: 1,[94] tubes due to be cached: 31. Before launch, 5 of the 43 tubes were designated “witness tubes” and filled with materials that would capture particulates in the ambient environment of Mars.[95] 
Cost
NASA plans to invest roughly US$2.75 billion in the project over 11 years, including US$2.2 billion for the development and building of the hardware, US$243 million for launch services, and US$291 million for 2.5 years of mission operations.[8][96] 
Adjusted for inflation, Perseverance is NASA's sixth-most expensive robotic planetary mission, though it is cheaper than its predecessor, Curiosity.[97] Perseverance benefited from spare hardware and "build-to print" designs from the Curiosity mission, which helped reduce development costs and saved "probably tens of millions, if not 100 million dollars" according to Mars 2020 Deputy Chief Engineer Keith Comeaux.[98] 
Commemorative artifacts
"Send Your Name to Mars"
NASA's "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign invited people from around the world to submit their names to travel aboard the agency's next rover to Mars. 10,932,295 names were submitted. The names were etched by an electron beam onto three fingernail-sized silicon chips, along with the essays of the 155 finalists in NASA's "Name the Rover" contest. The three chips share space on an anodized plate with a laser engraved graphic representing Earth, Mars, and the Sun. The rays emanating from the Sun contain the phrase "Explore As One" written in Morse code.[99] The plate was then mounted on the rover on 26 March 2020.[100] 
Part of Perseverance's cargo is a geocaching trackable item viewable with the SHERLOC's WATSON camera.[101] 
In 2016, NASA SHERLOC co-investigator Dr. Marc Fries — with help from his son Wyatt — was inspired by Geocaching's 2008 placement of a cache on the International Space Station to set out and try something similar with the rover mission. After floating the idea around mission management, it eventually reached NASA scientist Francis McCubbin, who would join the SHERLOC instrument team as a collaborator to move the project forward. The Geocaching inclusion was scaled-down to a trackable item that players could search for from NASA camera views and then log on to the site.[102] In a manner similar to the "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign, the geocaching trackable code was carefully printed on a one-inch, polycarbonate glass disk serving as part of the rover's calibration target. It will serve as an optical target for the WATSON imager and a spectroscopic standard for the SHERLOC instrument. The disk is made of a prototype astronaut helmet visor material that will be tested for its potential use in crewed missions to Mars. Designs were approved by the mission leads at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Public Affairs, and NASA HQ, in addition to Groundspeak Geocaching HQ.[103][104] 
Tribute to healthcare workers
Perseverance launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, which began to affect the mission planning in March 2020. To show appreciation for healthcare workers who helped during the pandemic, an 8 cm × 13 cm (3.1 in × 5.1 in) plate with a staff-and-serpent symbol (a Greek symbol of medicine) was placed on the rover. The project manager, Matt Wallace, said he hoped that future generations going to Mars would be able to appreciate healthcare workers during 2020.[105] 
Family portrait of NASA Mars rovers
One of the external plates of Perseverance includes a simplified representation of all previous NASA Martian rovers, Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, as well as Perseverance and Ingenuity, similar to the trend of automobile window decals used to show a family's makeup.[106] 
NASA outreach to students
In December 2021, the NASA team announced a program to students who have persevered with academic challenges. Those nominated will be rewarded with a personal message beamed back from Mars by the Perseverance rover. 
Media, cultural impact, and legacy
Parachute with coded message
The orange-and-white parachute used to land the rover on Mars contained a coded message that was deciphered by Twitter users. NASA's systems engineer Ian Clark used binary code to hide the message "dare mighty things" in the parachute color pattern. The 70-foot-wide (21 m) parachute consisted of 80 strips of fabric that form a hemisphere-shape canopy, and each strip consisted of four pieces. Dr. Clark thus had 320 pieces with which to encode the message. He also included the GPS coordinates for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's headquarters in Pasadena, California (34°11’58” N 118°10’31” W). Clark said that only six people knew about the message before landing. The code was deciphered a few hours after the image was presented by Perseverance's team.[107][108][109] 
"Dare mighty things" is a quote attributed to U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt and is the unofficial motto of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[110] It adorns many of the JPL center's wall.
